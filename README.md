This is the official repository for Pyramid Flow, a training-efficient **Autoregressive Video Generation** method based on **Flow Matching**. By training only on open-source datasets, it generates high-quality 10-second videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS, and naturally supports image-to-video generation.

## News

* `TODO` ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è Training code, inference code and model checkpoints (Cleaning).
* `2024.10.07`  üöÄüöÄüöÄ We release the [technical report](https://arxiv.org) and [project page](https://pyramid-flow.github.io) of Pyramid Flow.

## Introduction

![motivation](assets/motivation.jpg)

Existing video diffusion models operate at full resolution, spending a lot of computation on very noisy latents. By contrast, our method harnesses the flexibility of flow matching ([Lipman et al., 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PqvMRDCJT9t); [Liu et al., 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XVjTT1nw5z); [Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden, 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=li7qeBbCR1t)) to interpolate between latents of different resolutions and noise levels, allowing for simultaneous generation and decompression of visual content with better computational efficiency. The entire framework is end-to-end optimized with a single DiT ([Peebles & Xie, 2023](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Peebles_Scalable_Diffusion_Models_with_Transformers_ICCV_2023_paper.html)), generating high-quality 10-second videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS within 20.7k A100 GPU training hours.

## Comparison

On VBench ([Huang et al., 2024](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Vchitect/VBench_Leaderboard)), our method surpasses all the compared open-source baselines. Even with only public video data, it achieves comparable performance to commercial models like Kling ([Kuaishou, 2024](https://kling.kuaishou.com/en)) and Gen-3 Alpha ([Runway, 2024](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-gen-3-alpha)), especially in the quality score (84.74 vs. 84.11 of Gen-3) and motion smoothness.

We conduct an additional user study with 20+ participants. As can be seen, our method is preferred over open-source models such as [Open-Sora](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora) and [CogVideoX-2B](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo) especially in terms of motion smoothness.
